Decrypt Message
Decoded message replit: https://replit.com/@Mr-Adams/encoded-message-no-punctuation#main.py
- * I used frequency analysis and then used the key to decrypt the message

Encrypt Message
- * I would use a playfair cipher to encryt my message.
- * I think this method is quite creative and can provide some security by keeping the keyword secret
- * I love the three rules from the video to encode the message.
- * You need to create the 5 x 5 grid and fill it in using the secret word to encrypt the message
- * The grid is formed by first taking a code word (with duplicate letters removed) and then adding any alphabet characters missing. A digraph is transformed by looking up the two characters in the grid. If they form a rectangle, pick letters from the same rows but other corners. If they form a column, pick the letters one row down. If they form a row, pick the letters one step to the right. If they are same letter, add a padding letter (for instance X) or pick the letters on row down and one step to the right. https://www.boxentriq.com/code-breaking/playfair-cipher
- * Secret keyword = love 
- * secret message = Iloveyou 
- * encoded message = OHLOWVW

- * Test IL together first and they would follow rule three switching letters on either corner of the rectangle created getting HO
- * Test OV together first and they would follow rule two shifting each letter one to the right getting VE
- * Test EY together first and they would follow rule three getting FE
- * Test OU together first and they would follow rule two getting LW



Another option to encrypt:
- * I thought about using a ceaser style cipher, but have the key shift as well.
- * this would work by having an initial shift of lets say 3 and every 6 letters the shift gets doubled.  This would need a message of decent length to work and ensure that the key a frequency analysis does not easily identify the key to decrypt the message.
- * this would need a method to ignore non letter characters in the message
